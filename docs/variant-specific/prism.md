These conventions apply to any variant with a prism suit.

### Color Finesses (One-Away-From-Playable)

- For the purposes of *Finesses*, prism cards only "connect" if they are the direct next color.
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Prism 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that since prism 3 is green, prism 2 connects to green. Thus, this must be a *Finesse*.
  - Cathy plays her green as a prism 3.

### Color Bluffs (Two-Away-From-Playable)

- Players can perform a *Bluff* on a prism card with a color, as long as the focus of the clue is a valid *Bluff* target and the color represents a prism card that is *two-or-more-away-from-playable*.
- As a consequence of this, you can *Bluff* a prism 1 by cluing a prism 3 (with color).
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that prism 1 would connect to yellow, but it does not connect to green. Thus, this is just a *Bluff*.
  - Cathy marks her green card as either a green 2 (as a normal *Bluff*), a green 3 (as a *3 Bluff*), or a prism 3 (as a *Hard 3 Bluff*).

### Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue

- Often we are in a situation when the prism card of the same color is drawn by the player holding the non prism card (or vice versa).
- If a player has two cards clued with rank that are indistinguishable with either rank or color, it gets hard to tempo one of those cards unambiguously.
- In such a case, we agree that the color tempo clue focuses on the right most card, and the rank tempo clue focuses on the left most card.

#### Interaction with Tempo Clue Chop Move

- We agree that getting tempo on a card in such a situation has high value and we never chop move from such a tempo clue.
